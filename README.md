# üéπ Air-Piano

Air-Piano is a browser-based virtual piano that lets you play music using **hand gestures** instead of a physical keyboard.  
It uses **Web MIDI API** to generate MIDI signals from gestures, routes them through a **virtual MIDI port** (loopMIDI), and produces realistic piano sound via **Sforzando** using the included `SalamanderGrandPianoV3.sfz` sample set.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Play piano using just your **hand gestures** and a webcam.
- Uses **Web MIDI API** directly in the browser.
- Routes MIDI notes through **loopMIDI** into **Sforzando**.
- High-quality **Salamander Grand Piano** sampled instrument included (`.sfz`).
- Built with **React + Vite** for fast and modern development.
